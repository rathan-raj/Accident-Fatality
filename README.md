# Accident Fatality Prediction - Toronto Police Data (2006–2023)

This data science project aims to classify traffic accidents reported by the **Toronto Police** from **2006 to 2023** as **fatal** or **non-fatal** based on various incident features. The goal is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques that can help in analyzing and understanding accident severity patterns over time.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Problem Statement**: Predict whether a traffic accident is fatal or non-fatal.
- **Data Source**: Real-world data collected by the **Toronto Police Service** (2006–2023).
- **Approach**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification modeling using Python.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Accident_Fatality.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and model building.
- `train.csv`: Training dataset with labeled accident records.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset for evaluating model predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
